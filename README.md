## 🔧 How It Works
1. **Obstacle Detection** – Ultrasonic sensor emits sound waves and measures reflection time to detect objects.
2. **Processing** – ESP32 processes the sensor data in real-time.
3. **Alert System** – Audio feedback (buzzer) warns the user as they approach an obstacle.
4. **Emergency Feature** – Pressing the emergency button triggers an alarm or sends a help notification.
